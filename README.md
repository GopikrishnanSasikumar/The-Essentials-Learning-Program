# The Essentials Learning Program

Building something with code is a beautiful process. For the problem statement you come up with a solution with lots of thoughts and brainstorm with peers. From there you start a journey to transform that idea to the product you(and your peers) imagined. In this process a lot of knowledge and tools come in play that aid you to go forward in correct way and minimize efforts.

* Interpreters and compilers
* Package managers
* Code editor
* Git and GitHub
* Terminal/command prompts
* Bash commands, env variables and paths
* Documentations

While some of these are helper tools and concepts that ease your effort, some are strictly neccessary in the process. We can call them essentials all together. Because you will be utilising them throughout your coding journey. This learning program help you to master the essential tools and concepts.
