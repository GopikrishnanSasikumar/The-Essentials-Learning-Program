# The Essentials Learning Program

Building something with code is a beautiful process. For the problem statement you come up with a solution with lots of thoughts and brainstorm with peers. From there you start a journey to transform that idea to the product you(and your peers) imagined. In this process a lot of knowledge and tools come in play that aid you to go forward in correct way and minimize efforts.
