# The Essentials Learning Program

Building something with code is a beautiful process. For the problem statement you come up with a solution with lots of thoughts and brainstorm with peers. From there you start a journey to transform that idea to the product you(and your peers) imagined. In this process a lot of knowledge and tools come in play that aid you to go forward in correct way and minimize efforts.

* Programming languages
* Package managers
* Code editor
* Git and GitHub
* Terminal/command prompts
* Bash commands, env variables and paths
* Documentations
* Deployment tools

While some of these are helper tools and concepts that ease your effort, some are important ones in the process. We can call them essentials all together. Because you will utilise them throughout your coding journey. This learning program help you to master the essential tools and concepts.

## The Goal

Most of us started to learn code in school or college by writing code using this [GNU nano editor](https://www.nano-editor.org). Even though the vintage look and experience is cool, using a light weight text editor with next line suggestions like the following image will help you learn to code faster and in much better way.

Goal of this learning program is to teach such essential tools and concepts to those who are getting started with coding. 


## Running the Learning Program
