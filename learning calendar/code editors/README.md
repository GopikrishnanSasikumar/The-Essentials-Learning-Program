# Contents about various code editors

Here we explain what are code editors and various features and plugins available.

## What are code editors ? Perks of using one.
A best-fit code editor will make any developer more efficient at writing code. It will assist to examine code for less mistakes and show where edits need to be made. And, just as importantly, it will be customisable, allowing for the creation of a custom UI and an intuitive user experience for coding.

## Code formatting and intellisense.
Code formatting and intellisense are two important features of a code editor. Code formatting will make your code in a more readable form by automatically adding spaces and new lines based on the style of a programming language.

Intellisense will suggest next line or keyword while you type code. It is like the next word prediction in mobile keyboards.
