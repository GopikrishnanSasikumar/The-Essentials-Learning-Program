## Intro to package managers.

Package Managers are tools that help you manage the dependencies for your project. A dependency is code that is required for your program to function properly. These often come in the form of packages.

Packages can also have their own dependencies. Managing all these dependencies can be hard because packages may require specific versions of their dependencies. Itâ€™s easy to break something by modifying dependencies manually.

[Pip](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/) is the default package manager for python.
